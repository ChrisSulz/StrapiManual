# StrapiManual

## Project Information

Using **Cypress**, a **user manual** for the **Strapi** CMS was automatically generated as part of my bachelor's thesis. The basis for this project was the website at **[https://skb-virtuell.de/](https://skb-virtuell.de/)**. By chaining individual Cypress tests and generating reports with the help of **Mocha custom reports**, I was able to create HTML documents for each test suite and consolidate them into a **manual.html**. For ease of use within the manual.html, features include automatic generation of a **clickable table of contents**, the **"scroll-up" button**, and the built-in **search function** available in standard web browsers using Ctrl+F.

### Project Structure

- Cypress tests to monitor operations within the Strapi CMS:

  > /cypress/e2e/...cy.js

- Output of HTML files generated by the Mocha custom reporter, along with related files:

  > /cypress/reports-custom/...

- Collection of screenshots generated by Cypress:

  > /cypress/screenshots/...

- Supporting Cypress configurations, including automatic logins via session cookies:

  > /cypress/support/...

- Programmed Mocha custom reporter:

  > /reporter/custom-reporter.js

## Instructions

To generate your own user manual, follow these steps:

1. Install all dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Install Cypress:

   ```bash
   npm install cypress
   ```

3. Create tests within `/cypress/e2e/`:

- The filename must match the description used in the Cypress test  
  Example: `01 Test.cy.js` as the filename for a test described as `describe("01 Test", () => { ... });`
- The filename or description must begin with a numerical value followed by a space for proper sorting  
  Example: Use `01 Introduction.cy.js` as the filename, or `describe("01 Introduction", ...)` as the description
- Test groups (`it()`) should also begin with a numerical value or optionally a sequence of letters for clarity  
  Example: Use `it("A First Operation")`

4. Generate individual reports and the entire user manual `manual.html`  
   Target directory: `/cypress/reports-custom/`

   ```bash
   npx cypress run
   ```

### Customization Options

1. The appearance and styling of all elements can be adjusted through the CSS file:

   > /cypress/reports-custom/styles.css

2. Changing or replacing `logo.jpg` allows you to customize the logo within `manual.html`:

   > /cypress/reports-custom/logo.jpg

3. You can customize the text at the end of `manual.html` by modifying `footer.txt`:
   > /cypress/reports-custom/footer.txt

### Side notes

By commenting out commands, they won't be executed by Cypress during the test run, but they still appear as instructions in the respective HTML output and, consequently, in `manual.html`:

```javascript
// cy.visit("www.example.com");
```

This can be advantageous when you only want to provide an instruction to the end user, but the execution within a test could have significant consequences.

---

By creating a `credentials.json`, the automatic login process can be used with `cy.login()`:

```json
{
  "user": "user@email.com",
  "password": "password"
}
```

The `credentials.json` must be created manually at this location:

> /cypress/support/credentials.json
